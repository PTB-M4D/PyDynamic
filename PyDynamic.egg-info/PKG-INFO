        [![CircleCI Status](https://circleci.com/gh/eichstaedtPTB/PyDynamic/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/eichstaedtPTB/PyDynamic/tree/master) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pydynamic/badge/?version=latest)](https://pydynamic.readthedocs.io/?badge=latest)
        
        Python package for the analysis of dynamic measurements
        
        The goal of this package is to provide a starting point for users in metrology and related areas who deal with time-dependent, i.e. *dynamic*, measurements.
        The software is part of a joint research project of the national metrology institutes from Germany and the UK, i.e. [Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt](http://www.ptb.de/cms/en.html)
        and the [National Physical Laboratory](http://www.npl.co.uk).
        
        PyDynamic offers propagation of *uncertainties* for
        - application of the discrete Fourier transform and its inverse
        - filtering with an FIR or IIR filter with uncertain coefficients
        - design of a FIR filter as the inverse of a frequency response with uncertain coefficients
        - design on an IIR filter as the inverse of a frequency response with uncertain coefficients
        - deconvolution in the frequency domain by division
        - multiplication in the frequency domain
        - transformation from amplitude and phase to a representation by real and imaginary parts
        
        For the validation of the propagation of uncertainties, the Monte-Carlo method can be applied using a memory-efficient implementation of Monte-Carlo for digital filtering

        ### Installation
        If you just want to use the software, the easiest way is to run from your system's command line
        ```
          pip install PyDynamic
        ```
        This will download the latest version from the Python package repository and copy it into your local folder of third-party libraries. Note that PyDynamic uses **Python version 3.x**. Usage in any Python environment on your computer is then possible by
        ```python
          import PyDynamic
        ```
        or, for example, for the module containing the Fourier domain uncertainty methods:
        ```python
          from PyDynamic.uncertainty import propagate_DFT
        ```
        Updates can then be installed via
        ```
          pip install --upgrade PyDynamic
        ```
        
        For collaboration we recommend using [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) or any other git-compatible version control software and cloning the repository (https://github.com/eichstaedtPTB/PyDynamic.git). In this way, any updates to the software will be highlighted in the version control software and can be applied very easily.

        ### Examples
        Uncertainty propagation for the application of a FIR filter with coefficients *b* with which an uncertainty *ub* is associated. The filter input signal is *x* with known 
        noise standard deviation *sigma*. The filter output signal is *y* with associated uncertainty *uy*.
        ```python
            from PyDynamic.uncertainty.propagate_filter import FIRuncFilter
            y, uy = FIRuncFilter(x, sigma, b, ub)    
        ```
        
        
        Uncertainty propagation through the application of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The time domain signal is *x* with associated squared uncertainty *ux*. The result
        of the DFT is the vector *X* of real and imaginary parts of the DFT applied to *x* and the associated uncertainty *UX*.
        ```python
            from PyDynamic.uncertainty.propagate_DFT import GUM_DFT
            X, UX = GUM_DFT(x, ux)
        ```
        
        
        Sequential application of the Monte Carlo method for uncertainty propagation for the case of filtering a time domain signal *x* with an IIR filter *b,a* with uncertainty associated with
        the filter coefficients *Uab* and signal noise standard deviation *sigma*. The filter output is the signal *y and the Monte Carlo method calculates point-wise uncertainties *uy* and
        coverage intervals *Py* corresponding to the specified percentiles.
        
        ```python
            from PyDynamic.uncertainty.propagate_MonteCarlo import SMC
            y, uy, Py = SMC(x, sigma, b, a, Uab, runs=1000, Perc=[0.025,0.975])
        ```
