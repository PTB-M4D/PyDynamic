# Python library for the analysis of dynamic measurements

<p align="justify">
The goal of this library is to provide a starting point for users in metrology and
related areas who deal with time-dependent i.e., <i>dynamic</i>, measurements. The
initial version of this software was developed as part of a joint research project of
the national metrology institutes from Germany and the UK, i.e.
<a href="https://www.ptb.de/cms/en.html">Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt</a> 
and the <a href="https://www.npl.co.uk">National Physical Laboratory</a>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Further development and explicit use of PyDynamic is part of the European research
project <a href="https://www.ptb.de/empir2018/met4fof/home/">EMPIR 17IND12 
Met4FoF</a> and the German research project <a href="https://famous-project.
eu">FAMOUS</a>.

## Features

PyDynamic offers propagation of *uncertainties* for

- application of the discrete Fourier transform and its inverse
- filtering with an FIR or IIR filter with uncertain coefficients
- design of a FIR filter as the inverse of a frequency response with
  uncertain coefficients
- design on an IIR filter as the inverse of a frequency response with
  uncertain coefficients
- deconvolution in the frequency domain by division
- multiplication in the frequency domain
- transformation from amplitude and phase to a representation by real and
  imaginary parts
- 1-dimensional interpolation

For the validation of the propagation of uncertainties, the Monte-Carlo
method can be applied using a memory-efficient implementation of Monte-Carlo
for digital filtering.

## Module diagram

The fundamental structure of PyDynamic is shown in the following figure.

![PyDynamic module diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PTB-M4D/PyDynamic/master/docs/PyDynamic_module_diagram.png)

However, imports should generally be possible without explicitly naming all packages
and modules in the path, so that for example the following import statements are all
equivalent.

```python
from PyDynamic.uncertainty.propagate_filter import FIRuncFilter
from PyDynamic.uncertainty import FIRuncFilter
from PyDynamic import FIRuncFilter
```

## Documentation

The documentation for PyDynamic can be found on
[ReadTheDocs](http://pydynamic.readthedocs.io)

## Installation

The installation of PyDynamic is as straightforward as the Python ecosystem suggests.
Detailed instructions on different options to install PyDynamic you can find in the 
[installation section of the docs](https://pydynamic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/INSTALL.html).

## Examples

We have collected extended material for an easier introduction to PyDynamic in the
package _examples_. Detailed assistance on getting started you can find in the
corresponding sections of the docs:

* [examples](https://pydynamic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Examples.html)
* [tutorials](https://pydynamic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tutorials.html)

In various Jupyter Notebooks and scripts we demonstrate the use of
the provided methods to aid the first steps in PyDynamic. New features are introduced
with an example from the beginning if feasible. We are currently moving this supporting
collection to an external repository on GitHub. They will be available at
[github.com/PTB-M4D/PyDynamic_tutorials](https://github.com/PTB-M4D/PyDynamic_tutorials) 
in the near future.

## Roadmap

1. Implementation of robust measurement (sensor) models
1. Extension to more complex noise and uncertainty models
1. Introducing uncertainty propagation for Kalman filters
