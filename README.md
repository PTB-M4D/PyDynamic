Python package for the analysis of dynamic measurements

The goal of this package is to provide a starting point for users in metrology and related areas who deal with time-dependent, i.e. *dynamic*, measurements. The initial version of this software was developed as part of a joint research project of the 
national metrology institutes from Germany and the UK, i.e. [Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt](http://www.ptb.de/cms/en.html) and the [National Physical Laboratory](http://www.npl.co.uk).

Further development and explicit use of PyDynamic is part of the European research project [EMPIR 17IND12 Met4FoF](http://met4fof.eu) and the German research project [FAMOUS](https://famous-project.eu).

PyDynamic offers propagation of *uncertainties* for
- application of the discrete Fourier transform and its inverse
- filtering with an FIR or IIR filter with uncertain coefficients
- design of a FIR filter as the inverse of a frequency response with 
  uncertain coefficients
- design on an IIR filter as the inverse of a frequency response with 
  uncertain coefficients
- deconvolution in the frequency domain by division
- multiplication in the frequency domain
- transformation from amplitude and phase to a representation by real and 
  imaginary parts

For the validation of the propagation of uncertainties, the Monte-Carlo 
method can be applied using a memory-efficient implementation of Monte-Carlo 
for digital filtering

The documentation for PyDynamic can be found on [ReadTheDocs](http://pydynamic.readthedocs.io)

### Installation
If you just want to use the software, the easiest way is to run from your 
system's command line
```
pip install PyDynamic
```
This will download the latest version from the Python package repository and 
copy it into your local folder of third-party libraries. Note that PyDynamic 
uses **Python version 3.x**. Usage in any Python environment on your computer
 is then possible by
```python
import PyDynamic
```
or, for example, for the module containing the Fourier domain uncertainty 
methods:
```python
from PyDynamic.uncertainty import propagate_DFT
```
Updates can then be installed via
```
pip install --upgrade PyDynamic
```

For collaboration we recommend forking the repository as described [here
](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo), apply the changes and 
open a Pull Request on GitHub as described [here
](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request). In this way 
any changes to PyDynamic can be applied very easily.

If you have downloaded this software, we would be very thankful for letting 
us know. You may, for instance, drop an email to one of the [authors

### Examples
Uncertainty propagation for the application of a FIR filter with coefficients
*b* with which an uncertainty *ub* is associated. The filter input signal is
*x* with known noise standard deviation *sigma*. The filter output signal 
is *y* with associated uncertainty *uy*.
```python
from PyDynamic.uncertainty.propagate_filter import FIRuncFilter
y, uy = FIRuncFilter(x, sigma, b, ub)    
```

Uncertainty propagation through the application of the discrete Fourier 
transform (DFT). The time domain signal is *x* with associated squared 
uncertainty *ux*. The result of the DFT is the vector *X* of real and 
imaginary parts of the DFT applied to *x* and the associated uncertainty *UX*.
```python
from PyDynamic.uncertainty.propagate_DFT import GUM_DFT
X, UX = GUM_DFT(x, ux)
```

Sequential application of the Monte Carlo method for uncertainty propagation 
for the case of filtering a time domain signal *x* with an IIR filter *b,a* 
with uncertainty associated with the filter coefficients *Uab* and signal 
noise standard deviation *sigma*. The filter output is the signal *y and the 
Monte Carlo method calculates point-wise uncertainties *uy* and coverage 
intervals *Py* corresponding to the specified percentiles.
```python
from PyDynamic.uncertainty.propagate_MonteCarlo import SMC
y, uy, Py = SMC(x, sigma, b, a, Uab, runs=1000, Perc=[0.025,0.975])
```
